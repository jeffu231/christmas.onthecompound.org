Halloween is the primer for the Christmas display. We like Halloween almost as much as we do Christmas. The display is animated to music giving vistors an enjoyable sight and sound experience. The music is family friendly with selections that both kids and adults can recognize. The display runs from 5:00 until 10:30 everyday from early Oct through Halloween.
