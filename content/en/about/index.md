During the Christmas season, we expand the show from Hallween in a big way. Many more lights and a much more theatrical stage. It is a favorite of visitors near and far. The display is animated to music giving vistors an enjoyable sight and sound experience. The music is family friendly with selections that both kids and adults can recognize. We have been featured on many holiday light tours and news programs over the years. The display runs from 5:00 pm until 10:30 pm everyday from the weekend of Thanksgiving through New Years Day.
