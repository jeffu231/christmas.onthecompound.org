Preparations have already begun for the 2024 Christmas light show. Some updated songs and new elements are being added. Once Halloween is over, the setup for Christmas ramps up into high gear. Some of the Halloween lights are also used for Christmas and many more lights will go up. Nearly 50,000 in total up and down the entire street. Target date for the the show to go live is the weekend of Thanksgiving. We have to eat the turkey before we turn the lights on for Christmas. But if you come by Thanksgiving, you might just see Tom the Turkey keeping the fall themed lights warming up for Christmas.

Tune your radio to 93.3 FM to listen to the lights on the Compound Radio station. If your radio supports RDS, you can see the name of the song and the artist on your radio display. The ability to request your favorite song to play while visting the show will return this year with a new link.
